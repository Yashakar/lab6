            <h3>The Philosophical Questions</h3>
            <p>
                Destiny 2 tells a small story of a sub race or humans called Exos. The “Ship of Theseus” question is the
                main
                focus of this story, “If a ship has all its pieces replaced is it still the same ship.”. This small
                story
                can
                show how a narrative team can make a reader think hard about this question. A horror story draws in
                anticipation, and while there is not that much action, it shows that a good story doesn’t necessarily
                need
                it.

                <h3>What are Exo’s</h3>
                <p>These are mechanical frames that contain the consciousness of said humans in order to extend their
                    life.
                    Although
                    many would think of the wealthy and powerful to be participating in eternal life, it is instead the
                    lower
                    and
                    middle class humans that are targeted to be transformed into Exo’s. These people wouldn’t need to
                    sleep
                    or
                    eat,
                    but eventually they had to have the ability to do those things put into their design because their
                    mind
                    would
                    realize they did not have a real body and would begin to reject it, resulting in <a

                <h3>What is D.E.R</h3>
                <p>
                    A neuro-degenerative disease that plagued the earliest forms of Exo’s, and still does in the modern
                    age.
                    Although they are physically fine, the human mind could not understand what was going on with thier
                    bodies.
                    They
                    wouldn’t need to eat or sleep which would result in them eventually going crazy and killing
                    themselves.
